# Distributed LLM Training Pipeline

This project implements a scalable, distributed training pipeline for Large Language Models (LLMs). It's designed to be both educational and practical, allowing for incremental learning while building a production-grade system.

## Project Overview

This training pipeline includes:
- Distributed training capabilities using PyTorch Lightning
- Efficient data loading and processing
- Model training optimization
- Real-time monitoring and logging
- Configurable training parameters

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd distributed_llm_trainer

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start training
python scripts/run_training.py
```

## Key Components

### 1. Data Pipeline (`src/data/`)
- Efficient data loading using HuggingFace datasets
- Customizable preprocessing
- Batch processing optimization

### 2. Model Architecture (`src/model/`)
- Flexible model configuration
- Support for different model architectures
- Integration with HuggingFace transformers

### 3. Training Pipeline (`src/training/`)
- Distributed training support
- Mixed precision training
- Gradient accumulation
- Checkpoint management

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Integration with Weights & Biases
- Performance metrics tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring

## Configuration

The training pipeline can be configured through YAML files in the `config/` directory:

```yaml
model:
  name: "gpt2-small"
  hidden_size: 768
  num_attention_heads: 12

training:
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.0001
  max_epochs: 10
```

## Development Roadmap

### Week 1 Timeline:
- Day 1: Setup and basic implementation
- Day 2: Data pipeline implementation
- Day 3: Model and training loop
- Day 4: Distributed training setup
- Day 5: Monitoring integration
- Day 6-7: Testing and optimization

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with a small model (e.g., GPT2-small)
   - Use a subset of your data for initial testing
   - Validate each component independently

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Get basic training working first
   - Add distributed capabilities
   - Implement monitoring
   - Optimize performance

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for core components
   - Validate data pipeline
   - Test distributed training on small scale
   - Monitor resource usage

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   - Reduce batch size
   - Enable gradient accumulation
   - Use mixed precision training

2. **Slow Training**
   - Check data loading pipeline
   - Monitor GPU utilization
   - Adjust number of workers

3. **Distributed Training Issues**
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check port availability
   - Monitor process communication
